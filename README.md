## Project aim
-----------------
The aim of this project is to initiate a series of nested arrays within an object literal and implement functions that iterate through the object arrays to generate a random joke and response.

# The script will work as follows:
1. a function will serve to generate a random number based on the index length of the object's array passed as an argument.
2. The randomly generated number that corrsponds with an index in the 'jokes' array will be returned.
3. The object's second array (with a single element) will be returned.
4. a response from the object's third array will be concatinated onto the second array.
5. The returned strings will be pushed into a new empty array and logged to the console.
